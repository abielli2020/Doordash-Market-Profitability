# 📦 DoorDash Market Profitability Analysis

## 🗂️ Repository Overview

This repository contains the project files for the **DoorDash Market Analysis**, a simulation based on a real business case used in the DoorDash Strategy & Operations team. The goal of the project is to evaluate the performance of five markets using key business metrics and provide strategic recommendations based on data-driven insights.

## 📌 Project Details

### 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Assess market performance using metrics such as:
  - Total Orders
  - Total Profit
  - Cost per Acquisition (CPA)
  - Organic User Acquisition
- Rank the five markets from best to worst
- Recommend strategic actions tailored to each market’s challenges and opportunities
- Solve SQL-based questions related to dasher operations and delivery strategy

### 🧪 Methodology

#### Excel Workbook:
- Cleaned and analyzed data in Excel using formulas and pivot tables
- Calculated key performance indicators across five markets
- Created a stack-ranking framework to evaluate and compare market performance
- Drafted specific strategic recommendations based on results

#### SQL Queries:
- Wrote queries to examine operational KPIs such as:
  - Dasher utilization
  - Average delivery time by day/hour
  - Impact of pay structure on dasher performance
- Simulated real-world SQL tasks aligned with a Strategy & Operations Analyst role

### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Market 5**: Highest total profit and order volume—opportunity to double down on customer retention and upsell strategies
- **Market 4**: Strong overall metrics but slightly elevated CPA—optimize marketing spend and increase organic reach
- **Market 2**: Healthy organic user growth and profit—room to scale with more efficient acquisition channels
- **Market 3**: Average order volume but lower profit per user—needs pricing or monetization refinement
- **Market 1**: Weakest performance across all metrics—focus on user engagement and reevaluate marketing ROI

### 📈 Strategic Recommendations

Tailored action plans were developed for each market. For example:

- **Market 5**: Launch loyalty programs and explore cross-sell opportunities
- **Market 1**: Audit marketing channels and improve user experience to increase order frequency

See the Excel workbook for a full breakdown by market.

### 🪞 Reflection

This project demonstrated how a multi-metric approach—blending acquisition, monetization, and engagement—can uncover nuanced insights across markets. Even with similar CPA levels, markets underperformed due to weaker engagement or profit metrics. It also highlighted Excel’s power as a tool for building lightweight yet scalable strategic frameworks, and how SQL can support operational decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Excel**: Data cleaning, analysis, and business modeling  
- **SQL**: Operational analysis, metrics querying, and decision support  
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Strategic thinking, data storytelling, market evaluation, and performance optimization
