# **DoorDash Market Profitability Case**

This project simulates a real-world business case used in the DoorDash Strategy & Operations hiring process. I evaluated the performance of five distinct markets using Excel and SQL, focusing on profitability, order volume, cost per acquisition (CPA), and user acquisition trends. The objective was to identify over- and under-performing markets, develop a performance stack ranking, and deliver actionable strategic recommendations. Additionally, I tackled SQL-based challenges related to dasher efficiency, pay structure, and delivery patterns—mirroring the type of analytical and strategic work expected in a Strategy & Operations Analyst role at DoorDash.

## **Reflection**

This project reinforced the value of balancing efficiency with scalability. It highlighted how acquisition, monetization, and engagement must be evaluated in tandem to understand true market performance. Even with similar CPA, markets can underperform without strong user engagement or profit per user. It also showed how Excel can power lightweight yet impactful strategic analysis—an essential skill in roles like Strategy & Ops at DoorDash.
